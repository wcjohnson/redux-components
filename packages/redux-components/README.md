# redux-components
A component model for Redux state trees based on the React.js component model and other familiar design patterns from the React ecosystem.

> **NB:** redux-components 0.4 is built on ES2017+ JavaScript and is a major breaking change from 0.3. If you've written code against the 0.3 or earlier branches, you can stay on the 0.3 branch. If you want to migrate, you should check out [redux-components-legacy] (https://github.com/wcjohnson/redux-components/packages/redux-components-legacy) for the recommended migration path.

## Install
