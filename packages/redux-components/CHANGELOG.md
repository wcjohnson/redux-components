## 0.4.4

### API: `DynamicReducerComponent` no longer has a `getInitialState()` method

This way of populating state was not consistent with idiomatic Redux, where initial state is provided either by `createStore` or by default reducer args. `getInitialState` was removed in favor of using one of these idiomatic constructions.

(Technically this would be a major semver bump, but since the API was not yet documented, a minor bump is being issued.)

## 0.4.3

Miscellaneous nits only; no major changes.

## 0.4.2

### Bugfix: Reducer noise in subtrees

A component using `withSubtree` would receive a new state in its reducer even if none of the subcomponents issued a state change. This has been corrected.

## 0.4.1

### **MAJOR BREAKING CHANGE** ES2015+ API

- We've dropped our legacy CoffeeScript toolchain and moved to an ES2015 class-based API. This represents a totally breaking change to the redux-components API which is not backwards compatible.

- With the release of this new API, we consider ourselves to be on the 1.0 track. The general shape of the API is now frozen except for bugfixes. The next major release will be 1.0.0.

- In order to ease migration, we've developed [redux-components-legacy](https://github.com/wcjohnson/redux-components/packages/redux-components-legacy), a compatibility shim that implements the 0.3.x API on top of the new 0.4 internals. `redux-components-legacy` passes all of the 0.3.x unit tests, and is the recommended migration path forward for any apps on the 0.3 branch.

- You can also keep using the 0.3.x series, which will continue to receive bug fixes.

### Git mono-repo and Lerna build chain

The `redux-components` modules have been moved into a mono-repo managed by Lerna. Those embedding as a Git submodule should update accordingly (or stay on the 0.3 branch.)

- *POTENTIALLY BREAKING:* A number of utility functions (including most of the Observable implementation) have been factored out to other libraries as part of this change. These were not public API.

# 0.3

## 0.3.3

### SubtreeMixin changes

The new mounting system enabled a cleanup of the `SubtreeMixin` internals, including the removal of the `didMount` monkey patch. This should not be a breaking change for those following the API, but may break code relying on subtree internals.

- `SubtreeMixin` components now support dynamic mounting. (Meaning that the `SubtreeMixin` component can be dynamically mounted, not that its contents can change dynamically -- please use `redux-components-map` if you need that functionality.)

- A new documented field, `this.subtreeReducer`, exists on all `SubtreeMixin` component instances. This is the reducer obtained by `combineReducers` over the subcomponents. Using this functionality, it is now possible to write custom reducers for `SubtreeMixin` components that fallback on the combined reducer when they don't understand an action.

- The `__reducerMap` and `__originalDidMount` undocumented fields no longer exist.

### Miscellaneous

- The `Object.assign` polyfill has been removed. Your runtime must support `Object.assign` natively, or you must polyfill it yourself.

## 0.3.2

### Observable selector changes

We've made some changes to make observable selectors more convenient. None of these are breaking changes.

- All selectors on all ReduxComponents are now observable by default. It is no longer necessary to use `ObservableSelectorMixin`. `ObservableSelectorMixin` will continue to  exist for backwards compatibility, but is simply an empty mixin now.

- It is now possible to call `selector.next` even if the selector's owning component is not yet mounted. The attachment of the `Observer` to the selector will then be deferred until the component is mounted.

- The internal implementation of selectors has been refactored so that there is no penalty for the `Observable` implementation unless you actually attach an `Observer`.

## 0.3.1

### Added `component.isMounted()` API

There is now a `component.isMounted()` API which returns true when the component is mounted and false otherwise.

## 0.3.0

### **BREAKING CHANGE:** New component mounting API

In light of the architectural changes in 0.2, and because the old API was quite confusing, we've designed a new API for mounting components. The `mounter` function has been eliminated and replaced with an imperative API for mounting and unmounting.

For those managing their entire state tree with `redux-components`, the transition should be easy: replace your single `mountComponent` statement with the new `mountRootComponent`, which has the same argument signature.

Those with more complex state tree designs will want to [read the docs](https://wcjohnson.gitbooks.io/redux-components/content/docs/API/mountComponent.html).

### ReduxComponentClasses can now be used as mixins.

A `ReduxComponentClass` (the object returned by `createClass`) can now be used as a mixin on any other class. This can be used to simulate class inheritance in many use cases.

### actionDispatchers now support falsy return values

In 0.2, `actionDispatchers` were added to directly dispatch actions to a mounted component's store. They were required to return a valid Redux action. Now they may return a falsy value, in which case no action will be dispatched.

### Minor changes and fixes

- Redux is now listed as a dependency rather than a peerDependency.
- The internal `__reducerMap` variable on `SubtreeMixin` instances has been removed.

# 0.2

This is a major release that brings some changes that my team is excited about.

We want to know what you think about redux-components. As always, feel free to file an issue if you find a bug or want a feature.

We'd also love to see more people using the library. Many people in the Redux community are now catching on to this concept (e.g. [redux-interactions](https://github.com/convoyinc/redux-interactions), [redux-modules](https://github.com/procore/redux-modules)) which leads me to believe there's something important at the bottom here. If you like redux-components, tell your friends! If you're using redux-components (or another library like redux-components) tell us what works and doesn't work for you.

### **BREAKING CHANGE:** CommonJS require() cherry-picking from package root is no longer supported.

In 0.1.x, under CommonJS, you could `require()` specific submodules with e.g. `require('redux-components/createClass')`. This cherry-picking is no longer supported. Redux-components is moving to the ES Modules + Babel model, so individual submodules are exported from the `index` module.

The correct way to pick out submodules under CommonJS going forward is `{ createClass } = require('redux-components')`.

Unfortunately, the docs were written in the cherry-picking style, so users of the library are likely doing so as well. The docs have been updated to reflect the Babel+CommonJS style.

### ES2015 Module build

0.2.x now exports appropriate `jsnext:main` and `module` entries from `package.json` allowing for `import` as an ES2015 module:

```coffeescript
import { createClass } from 'redux-components'
```

CommonJS is still supported subject to the caveats above.

### Git Submodule support

Some people on my team were upset about how I broke Git submodule support in 0.1, so I fixed it for 0.2. You can now check out redux-components directly from Git as a submodule beneath some `node_modules` folder in your project. After an initial `npm install` to set up the git hooks, everything should work automatically, including a `post-merge` hook to rebuild the `lib` and `es` artifacts whenever you merge from upstream.

### Action Dispatchers

A new component specification entry, `spec.actionDispatchers`, has been added:
```coffeescript
spec.actionDispatchers = { key: (args...) => action, ... }
```

Action dispatchers are like action creators, except that they are automatically wrapped with `dispatch()` for the appropriate Redux Store when the component is mounted. Calling an action dispatcher will save you the extra step of calling `dispatch` yourself.

>**NB:** Your action dispatchers must return actions, just as action creators do.

### Reducer Indirection and Dynamic Reducers

- The `reducer` property of each `ReduxComponent` instance is now a lightweight thunk reducer that indirectly calls the last return value from `getReducer`.

- `spec.getReducer` has a new signature:
```coffeescript
spec.getReducer = (state?) => (state, action) => nextState
```

- If you register a class with a `getReducer` function taking zero arguments, the internal behavior of the `ReduxComponent` is the same as it was in 0.1.x.

- If you create a class with a `getReducer` function taking one or more arguments, the internal behavior of the `ReduxComponent` changes:
	- `getReducer` will be passed the current state of the component as its first argument.
	- The thunk reducer will call whatever you return from `getReducer`, allowing you to update your reducer dynamically.
	- Your `ReduxComponent` instance will have an `updateReducer()` method that will cause `getReducer` to be invoked. `updateReducer` is impure. **DO NOT** call `updateReducer` from inside of a reducer.

> **NB:** Dynamic reducers are an advanced and dangerous feature. You should only use them if you are completely certain that you need them. Don't forget the Redux contract!
- Reducers should be pure functions of state and action. Dynamic reducer behavior should only be used when you are sure you can honor this contract.
- In particular, you should think of "the state of your dynamic reducer" as being a part of your app's overall state.
- That means the behavior of a dynamic reducer should be a pure function of some branch of your state tree.
- If you make dynamic reducer behavior depend on stateful information that isn't stored in Redux, you are virtually guaranteed to break core Redux features like time travel and rehydration.

### Observable Selectors

A new mixin, `ObservableSelectorMixin`, has been provided. When mixed into a component, all `selectors` declared on the component will be instantiated as [ES7 Observables](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-observable) when the component is mounted.

If `componentInstance` is an instance of a component that uses `ObservableSelectorMixin`, and `selector` is one of its selectors, then `componentInstance.selector.subscribe(observer)` will invoke `observer.next(value)` whenever the value returned by the selector changes.

> The observable implementation assumes your store's state obeys the Redux contract, so `===` equality is used to compare selector values.
